# Hi there, I'm Kristoffer Nerskogen Helle 👋

I'm a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** from Norway with a strong interest in building systems that span **web, desktop, mobile, hardware, and embedded software**.

I enjoy working end-to-end — from user interfaces and APIs to low-level system design and real-time communication.
